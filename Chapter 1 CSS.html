      HTML just defined the layout of our webpage but the main beautification is
      done through CSS

      The term CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. Hence we can conclude that, the
      HTML is like skeletal system of a human body while CSS is the skin and
      JavaScript/Python and other backend languages are the Muscles of the human
      body.

      CSS is very demanded skill and with this, you can make websites like NASA,
      and many other websites which include animations and many other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use classes and ids to define HTML elements and hence use this system
      to beautify it using CSS.
