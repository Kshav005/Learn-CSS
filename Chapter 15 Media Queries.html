    <p>Media Queries? What is a media query? It is not as complicated as it looks but understand it as 'if-else' statements which only activates certain CSS properties when a condition is met.</p>
    <p>To begin a media query, we use '@media screen and (window_size : 900px) {property------------------}</p>
    <p>So basically, the above code says, when the screen size (height/width) becomes 900px, then perform a property. Let's try doing it with our current webpage.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now try decreasing the size of the browser window. You will see sudden black when you reach a certain width.</p>

    <p>This chapter is really short but understand that this chapter is very important as, for a web dev, it's important to make a website responsive, which means to make a website available to all user who use phone, laptop etc. It's not about your computer only. The webpages will be seen by the world. If you don't make your webpages responsive, then some user will not be able to enjoy some of the features. Some mobile users may not be able to see elements due to extra large font of a word which was actually small in your computer. So, try to understand the chapters where positions, layouts and media queries are there. It may be a tough job but is actually valuable. </p>
    <p>Hence, the CSS comes to an end here. Some of the properties were not discussed here as they are rarely used. Now you can take on some exercises in order to practice your web designing skills. And also make sure you performed all the exercises of CSS all by yourself! If you were success in doing that, then have a look at bootstrap too. Try to build a overpowered website all by yourself using Bootstrap and stuff! Good luck coding!</p>
