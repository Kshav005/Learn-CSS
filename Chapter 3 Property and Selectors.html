<!-- So we learnt how to use CSS, now is the time to learn about some terms.  -->

<!-- What is Property? -->
<!-- Property is the particular thing we want to change in an element. For example - font, background-color, color, etc -->

<!-- What is Selector? -->
<!-- Selector is the element you are selecting, i.e. Class and ID. You can also select a tag directly, like h1, p, h2 and others. So, in a simple terms classes, ids and the tags we are changing are known as selectors. We need to use "#" for ID, "." for classes, no prefix for elements and '*' to select all the elements. Below are the examples. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <style>
      p {
        font-size: 0.7cm;
      }
      h1 {
        color: brown;
      }
      #a1 {
        color: blue;
        font-family: "Franklin Gothic Medium", "Arial Narrow", Arial, sans-serif;
      }
      .hi {
        font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif;
        font-style: italic;
      }
      * {
        padding: 3%;
      }
    </style>
    <!-- padding is the gap between every element -->

    <title>Chapter 3</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Color will change here!</h1>
    <h1>I will have the same color as above because we both are 'h1'</h1>

    <p class="hi">I will not change because I am in class!</p>
    <p id="a1">While I am under uniquely specified ID</p>
  </body>
</html>
