# Learn-CSS

This repository is a tutorial which will help you to learn CSS. It can also help you in revising it but according to me, use it to revise and not for tutorial because there are many youtube videos which will teach you CSS more efficiently. It will be having all the images which I used in showing example. But if I suggest then use these files and then open them in VS Code along with browser (open the file in that browser). I hope you get to learn something from it!

# Exercises 
1. Exercise on Chapter 3 - You need to create a class and use it on every element to change the background color to Orange.
2. Exercise on Chapter 4 - In this exercise, you will be creating a box and you need to make it non-scrollable. It means you need to make that box sticked to it's position, no matter how much we scroll.
3. Exercise on Chapter 8 - Create a navigation bar (the bar which is stuck on the top containing 'Home', 'About', etc) and make it non-scrollable. Then create a box which will be having width equal to 20% of your monitor height, and height equal to 10% of the total width of your monitor or any device you are using.
4. Exercise on Chapter 9 - This exercise wants you to create a navigation bar containing 'Home', 'Mail Us' and more buttons like these (written in the file) and then create two boxes. The one box shoud be on extreme left, while the other should be on the extreme right. There are two ways to solve this question - Flexbox and Float.
5. Exercise on Chapter 13 - For this exercise, you have to create a progress bar like Youtube. You must have seen one on the top of that youtube page. A red coloured line which comes whenever you go to a new webpage in youtube. Then, you need to insert an image which rotates continuously. You can create one like this, using the animation of CSS.
6. Exercise on Chapter 14 - In this exercise, you have to create a table using the grid feature in CSS. All the information is given in that file.
7. Exercise on Chapter 15 - Create a webpage, where the background color is yellow in the starting, becomes green at some width, then becomes blue at another width dimenstion, then purple at other width dimension. The hint is mediabox, to solve this!
8. Final Exercise - The exercise is really simple. All you need is to create a nice webpage all by yourself. No matter, what content it has or it has navbar or not. Just create one, in order to practice your skills. I have created one, related to Alpha Laptops which sells computer related items to their customers. The webpage will be not responsive, but I will be upload a photo of the webpage of how it looks. So, that you can know how can CSS be used professionally. The images of this webpage will be having names 'alpha1.jpg' and so on.

I hope you learnt wonderfully and solved all the exercises all by yourself. You can practice your skills by creating more webpages! Good luck and I hope you succeed in learning! Happy coding!
